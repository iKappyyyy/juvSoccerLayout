W.I.P

Features that need to be done:
- Create First Webpage
- Create Second Webpage
- Phone Integration

I couldn't fit in every example card but I wanna be able to click the card and have a list
of players to choose from. whether that list is on the side or is kind of like a dropdown menu I am yet to decide
